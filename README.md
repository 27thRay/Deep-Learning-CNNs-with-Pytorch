# Deep-Learning-CNNs-with-Pytorch
Deep Learning Module in Singapore Polytechnic Year 2 Sem 2 in Artificial Intelligence & Analytics Course, Performing CNNs in CA1 with Pytorch on Fashion MNIST Dataset and CIFAR-100 Dataset
For Part A - CNN on the Fashion MNIST Dataset

After these experiments, I made my own VGG inspired model based on the experiment results
Final Model achieved 91.42% Accuracy with Good Accuracy and Loss curves
For Part B - CNN on the CIFAR-100 Dataset
