After these experiments, I made my own VGG inspired model based on the experiment results
Final Model achieved 91.42% Accuracy with Good Accuracy and Loss curves


For Part B - CNN on the CIFAR-100 Dataset

After these experiments, I made my own ResNet18 inspired model based on the experiment results
Final Model achieved 75.51% Accuracy with Good Accuracy and Loss curves
